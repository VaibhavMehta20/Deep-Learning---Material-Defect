# Deep-Learning---Material-Defect

This project explores the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to predict solidification defects in materials, even when only a small dataset is available. Traditionally, DNNs require large datasets to perform well, and with small datasets, they often underperform compared to traditional machine learning methods like shallow neural networks and support vector machines. However, in material science, collecting large datasets is challenging.
